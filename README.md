Module 15 Challenge - UWA Data Analytics Bootcamp

This repository contains the code to produce a map visualisation that plots earthquakes from the last 7 days.

The HTML file is contained within the 'Leaflet-Part-1' folder, with the relevant JavaScript and CSS files found in 'static' within corresponding folders.

The magnitude of the earthquake is signified by the size of each marker on the map. The depth is notified by the colour of each marker, with the legend in the bottom right signifying the corresponding depth value.
